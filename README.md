# Value-at-Risk-VaR-Conditional-Value-at-Risk-CVaR-Model
This project implements an Excel-based Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) model, key risk management metrics used to assess potential financial losses. It includes historical, variance-covariance simulations for VaR estimation, along with CVaR for tail-risk analysis.
