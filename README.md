# Value-at-Risk-VaR-Conditional-Value-at-Risk-CVaR-Model
This project implements an Excel-based Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) model, key risk management metrics used to assess potential financial losses. It includes historical, variance-covariance simulations for VaR estimation, along with CVaR for tail-risk analysis.
<br>
<br>
This repository contains an Excel-based implementation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), widely used risk management techniques to quantify potential losses in financial portfolios. The model provides multiple approaches for VaR estimation, including:
<br>
âœ… Historical VaR â€“ Uses past returns to estimate the loss threshold.
<br>
âœ… Variance-Covariance VaR â€“ Assumes returns follow a normal distribution, using mean and standard deviation.
<br>
âœ… Monte Carlo Simulation â€“ Generates thousands of possible return scenarios for more robust risk estimation.
<br>
âœ… Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) â€“ Measures expected losses beyond the VaR threshold, capturing tail risk.
